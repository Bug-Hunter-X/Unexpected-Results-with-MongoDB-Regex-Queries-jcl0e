# Unexpected Results with MongoDB Regex Queries

This repository demonstrates a common error when using regular expressions in MongoDB queries.  Incorrectly using case-insensitive flags or failing to properly escape special characters can lead to unexpected results or query failures. The `bug.js` file shows an example of problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem
The original code uses a regular expression with a case-insensitive flag (`i`) but might not properly handle edge cases or special characters in the pattern. This can result in incorrect matching or query errors.

## Solution
The corrected code emphasizes the importance of carefully crafting regular expressions for MongoDB, using proper escaping for special characters if needed. It provides a more robust and reliable query.
